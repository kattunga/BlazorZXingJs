The ordering is always x, y.\n * The origin is at the top-left.</p>\n *\n * <p>Internally the bits are represented in a 1-D array of 32-bit ints. However, each row begins\n * with a new int. This is done intentionally so that we can copy out a row into a BitArray very\n * efficiently.</p>\n *\n * <p>The ordering of bits is row-major. Within each int, the least significant bits are used first,\n * meaning they represent lower x values. This is compatible with BitArray's implementation.</p>\n *\n * @author Sean Owen\n * @author dswitkin@google.com (Daniel Switkin)\n */\nexport default class BitMatrix /*implements Cloneable*/ {\n\n    /**\n     * Creates an empty square {@link BitMatrix}.\n     *\n     * @param dimension height and width\n     */\n    // public constructor(dimension: number /*int*/) {\n    //   this(dimension, dimension)\n    // }\n\n    /**\n     * Creates an empty {@link BitMatrix}.\n     *\n     * @param width bit matrix width\n     * @param height bit matrix height\n     */\n    // public constructor(width: number /*int*/, height: number /*int*/) {\n    //   if (width < 1 || height < 1) {\n    //     throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Both dimensions must be greater than 0\")\n    //   }\n    //   this.width = width\n    //   this.height = height\n    //   this.rowSize = (width + 31) / 32\n    //   bits = new int[rowSize * height];\n    // }\n\n    public constructor(private width: number /*int*/, private height?: number /*int*/,\n        private rowSize?: number /*int*/, private bits?: Int32Array) {\n        if (undefined === height || null === height) {\n            height = width;\n        }\n        this.height = height;\n        if (width < 1 || height < 1) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException('Both dimensions must be greater than 0');\n        }\n        if (undefined === rowSize || null === rowSize) {\n            rowSize = Math.floor((width + 31) / 32);\n        }\n        this.rowSize = rowSize;\n        if (undefined === bits || null === bits) {\n            this.bits = new Int32Array(this.rowSize * this.height);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Interprets a 2D array of booleans as a {@link BitMatrix}, where \"true\" means an \"on\" bit.\n     *\n     * @function parse\n     * @param image bits of the image, as a row-major 2D array.
